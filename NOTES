sr_solution binary was built for x86_64 architecture

pox should be under ~/pox (see symbolic link)
(clone the pox repo and checkout to f95dd1a81584d716823bbf565fa68254416af603)

in case you are missing dependencies:
sudo apt-get install python-twisted

git clone git://github.com/dound/ltprotocol.git
cd ltprotocol
sudo python setup.py install

you should then be able to run config.sh without errors
